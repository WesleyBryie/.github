## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the event that you discover a vulnerability with any of my code, I encourage you to follow the below steps so we can solve this problem.

1. Write a detailed description as to what the vulnerability is. This should include the code relevant (preferred, not mandatory).
2. Download and use my GPG Public Key and encrypt the description.
3. Send me an email at wes(at)wesbryie.com containing the encrypted description.

Any attempt to report a vulnerability with my code outside of this cannot guarantee a response.

I recommend reading [this article](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x110.html) if you are unsure as to how to encyrpt documents using GPG.
